              Paddle offers SaaS companies a completely different approach to
              their payments infrastructure. Instead of assembling and
              maintaining a complex stack of payments-related apps and services,
              we’re a merchant of record for our customers, taking away 100% of
              the pain of payments fragmentation. It’s faster, safer, simpler,
              and above all, way better.
